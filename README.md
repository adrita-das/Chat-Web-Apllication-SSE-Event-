Welcome to the party, pal!

This is a [Partykit](https://partykit.io) project, which lets you create real-time collaborative applications with minimal coding effort.

[`server.js`](./src/server.js) is the server-side code, which is responsible for handling WebSocket events and HTTP requests. [`client.jsx`](./src/client.jsx) is the client-side code, which connects to the server and listens for events.

## Instalation

### Start Development Server

```npx partykit dev```
